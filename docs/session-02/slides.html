  <div> Three types of generative models in computer vision - different architectures and mechanisms </div>

   <div> 🤓 what are we talking about when we talk about "a model that can generate images"? </div>

  <div> 🤓 we are talking about: 
     <br /> 
    - models that can *output* images: what does this tell you about the shape of the last layer of the model?
     <br /> 
    - - The number of neurons in the last layer = [the number of pixels * the number of color channels] in the desired output image. </div>

  <div> 🤓 we are talking about: 
     <br /> 
    - models that can output images *according to some human instruction*
     <br /> 
    - - We'll see later that human instruction can come from the curation of training dataset and/or model's input layer. </div>

  <div> 🤓 we are talking about: 
     <br /> 
    - models that can output images that do not look like the same every time: there should be some sort of randomness in the inference process.
     <br /> 
    - - We'll see later that all generative models have some sort of "sampling process" to get "randomly sampled vectors" that are of the same shape but have different values everytime sampled. </div>

  
  <div>
  Let's move on to demystify the main three image generative model families, one by one 😎
    <br /> 
    - VAE: Variational AutoEncoder 
    <br /> 
    - GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks
    <br /> 
    - Diffusion
  </div>

    <div> 😎 VAE
    <br /> - Check the fun demo on this worth-reading article <a href="https://distill.pub/2017/aia/"> Using Artificial Intelligence to Augment Human Intelligence </a>
     <br /> - The font generating model is a VAE under the hood. 
  
  </div>

  <div> 😎 VAE is a variant of a neural net architecture called AE (Autoencoder) 
  <br /> Let's start from introducing the architecture of AE.
  </div>

    <div>  AE - the architecture 🤗
     <br /> 
     - 1. It is characterised by a bottleneck hidden layer - layer that has a *small* number of neuron which forces information to be compressed to have lower dimensions.
     <br /> 
     - 2. Training is done via reconstructing the input, i.e. the output layer tries to output exactly what is in the input layer.
      <br />  
      - 3. This "encode - decoder" or "compress - decompress" setup may seem redundant, but doing so allows us to extract the "essence" representation from the bottleneck layer.
  
  </div>
  
  


  <div>     
       VAE - the architecture 🤗
                  <br /> 
                
               Read <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/difference-between-autoencoder-ae-and-variational-autoencoder-vae-ed7be1c038f2/">this article</a>

                <br />
                
                - 1.The bottleneck layer of AE is deterministic - same input gets the same bottleneck representation.
                     <br /> 
                - 2. VAE changes the deterministic bottleneck layer into a layer with a distribution ("randomness").
                 <br /> 
                - 3. Check the article for why and how.
                
  </div>

    <div>     
       VAE - another application in the industry 🤗

  <div> 😎 Move onto GAN </div>

  <div> 
    GAN 🕶️
     <br />

  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    How does GAN work? 🕶️ the configuration: 
     <br />    
    - It is an ensemble of two neural networks - a Generator (G) and a Discriminator (D).
       <br />    
     - We have a training dataset that comprises images that you want the model to model from, we would refer to these as "real" images, as opposed to the generated "fake" ones.
 
  </div>

    
  <div> 
    How does GAN work? 🕶️ what are the G and the D doing?
     <br />    
    - Discriminator: a good old classification model that predicts if an image is real (from the training dataset) or fake (being generated).
       <br />    
    - Generator: it take a random vector as input and outputs a 2D matrix as a generated image.
  <br />    
    (no magic yet... we just set up two individual neural nets.)

  </div>

    <div> 
    How does GAN work? 🕶️ the training process:
     <br />    
    - The magic happens when we train G and D alternatively in a particlar way:
       <br />    
   - - It is a tom and jerry game between these two networks Generator 🐭 and Discriminator 🐈
  <br />    
   - - where D tries to catch G as a fake image generator ️🕵️‍♀️
   <br />    
   - - and G tries to fool D into thinking that G produces real images 🤡

        <div> 
   Hands-on 🎳
      <br />
    - Let's take a look at this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/generative/dcgan.ipynb">google colab notebook for training a simple GAN</a> 
     <br />
      - - Which part of code corresponds to Generator?
           <br />
      - - Which part of code corresponds to Discriminator?
        <br />
       - - Which part of code corresponds to assemblying G and D losses ?   
        </div>

          <div> 
   Problems of the vanilla GAN
      <br />
    - 😥It is notoriously unstable to train sometimes.
     <br />
     - 🥵Think about what happen if the D learns too fast and becomes a really good discriminator while the generator has barely learned anything?
           <br />
      (The generator can no longer get good supervision signal and just get stuck being a noise generator - in this case we have to terminate the training and start over again with a different settup, e.g. another random seed, etc. )
        </div>

      <div> 
    😎 Variants of GAN that performs better:
     <br />    
    - WGAN 
      <br />
    - <a href="https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/gan-wasserstein-gan-wgan-gp-6a1a2aa1b490">ProGAN</a> (Progressive growing GAN)
      <br />
    - <a href="https://pub.towardsai.net/introduction-to-stylegan-ec0a6b0706c">StyleGAN</a> 
    <br />
    StyleGAN is the "industry-level" GAN which is behind thispersondoesnotexist and <a href="https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/">more</a>  etc.

  </div>
  
  
       <div> 
 😎 DIFFUSION!
         - Let's have some <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion">stable diffusion fun</a>  
  </div>

      <div> 
   😎 Diffusion model! - high level understanding - level 0
     <br />    
    - It's yet another generative model.
      <br />
    - Recall that the GAN model generates an image from some sampled random noise?
<br />
   - Diffusion model also generates an image from some sampled random noise.
<br />
    - Though the diffusion model deploys a very different mechanism for image denoising/generation.
  </div>

        <div> 
    😎 Diffusion model! - high level understanding - level 1
     <br />    
    ✌️There are two processes involved in training a diffusion
model: forward diffusion and backward diffusion.
      <br />
    - ⏩Forward diffusion: we start from a clear good image, and gradually add noises to it till it is completely noisy.
<br />
   - ⏪Backward/reverse diffusion: we start from a noise-only image, and gradually remove noises from it till it becomes a clear good image.
<br />
   - The actual generation process when inferencing a diffusion model is just that reverse diffusion process.
  </div>

 How about the text input, aka the multi-modal stuff?
         - Let's read <a href="https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/">this article</a>  
  </div>
 
   
        <div> 
  
    Homework:
      <br />
    - Inference <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3">StyleGAN3</a> or <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2">StyleGAN2</a> (choose one or more pre-trained models from the repos) on your laptop or CCI desktop computers (at UAL High Holborn 3rd floor).
   <br />
    - Train a <a href="https://github.com/red-x-silver/PokeGAN">Pokemon GAN</a> on your laptop or the CCI desktop computers (at UAL High Holborn 3rd floor). Show me your pokemons!
   <br />
     - Inference a stable diffusion model from your laptop with the <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/overview">hugging face library for stable diffusions</a>, it is SO HANDY!
    <br />
    - [Optional but highly rewarding] Train a StyleGANX on the workstation, using a custom dataset (think of an applicatin that is interesting to you!).
  </div>

          <div>
