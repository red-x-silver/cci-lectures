  <div> Recap on "data modality"</div>

  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    Information that we can gather from the world and store in digital systems as "data", are mainly from four modalities:
      <br />   
    - 👁️Image (picture, video)
      <br />   
    - 📝Text (written language)
      <br />   
    - 🎵Audio (music, speech)
      <br />   
    - 🧩Tabular(this week's weather in degree celsius, everyone's birthday in this class, sensor data, etc.)
      <br />  
      Can you think of any information that is not from the four categories?
  </div>
  
  
  <div> 
    Data modalities🕶️
     <br />    
    - Each data modality has its own characteristics and challenges for representation, processing and analysis.
      <br />
     - We structure our unit syllabus based on the different data modalities, each week focusing on one modality (with a few exceptions).
      <br />
  </div>

    <div>
      Modalities covered in the following weeks:
 
    <br /> 
    - AI in Computer Vision 👁️: images, multi-modal
    <br /> 
    - AI in audio and music 🎵: audio, multi-modal

    Neural network architecture 🎳
    <br />    
    - Neural nets comprise of layers.
      <br />
    - There are different types of layers (fully connected, convolutional, recurrent, attention, etc.)
      <br />
    - Here is <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html">a list of layers implemented by Pytorch</a> (have you used Pytorch before?)

    Questions for checking understanding 🤔

    <br />    
    - What is an MLP?
      <br />
    - What is a CNN?
      <br />
    - What is an RNN?
      <br />
    - What is a Transformer?
    </div>

      <div> 
   🤔 How to inference a neural network? The process:
    <br />  - - feed input data into the model and get the output from the model
      <br /> - - also called the forward pass
     <br /> - - also called 'testing' or 'evaluation'
      <br /> - - inference does not involve backpropagation
      <br /> !No need to hard memorise!
 </div>

       <div> 
     🤔 How to train a neural network? The process:
    <br />  - - feed input data into the model and get the output from the model
      <br /> - - compare the model output with the ground truth and calculate the loss
      <br /> - - use backpropagation to update the model parameters
      <br /> - - repeat the above steps until the model converges
      <br /> - - this whole process is called training
      <br /> - - training involves both forward pass and backward pass

 </div>

        <div> 
 
    🤔 How to train a neural network? The dataset and splits:
      <br /> - - training is done on a training dataset
      <br /> - - the trained model is then evaluated on a validation dataset and/or a test dataset
      <br /> - - the trained model is then deployed for inference on new data
 </div>

        <div> 
  🤔 How to train a neural network? The hyperparameters: 

      <br /> - - training is done using an optimisation algorithm (e.g. SGD, Adam, etc.)
      <br /> - - training is done using a loss function (e.g. cross-entropy, MSE, etc.)
      <br /> - - training is done using a learning rate (e.g. 0.001, 0.01, etc.)
      <br /> - - training is done using a batch size (e.g. 32, 64, etc.)
      <br /> - - training is done using a number of epochs (e.g. 10, 20, etc.)
      <br /> - - training is done using a validation set to monitor overfitting
      <br /> - - training is done using regularisation techniques (e.g. dropout, weight decay, etc.)
 <br />
      <br /> !No need to hard memorise! These knowledges are best internalised through hands-on practice.
    </div>


            <div> 
 
     📙 Terminologies:
      <br /> 1️⃣Pre-trained
      <br /> - - means a ready-to-use model
      <br /> - - means a model that has been trained on a dataset (often large) and can be fine-tuned on a smaller dataset for a specific task in the future
       <br />
      <br /> 2️⃣Fine-tuning 
      <br /> - - means further training a pre-trained model on a smaller dataset for a specific task
      <br /> - - means updating the model parameters using backpropagation on the smaller dataset
      <br /> - - means the model is adapted to the specific task and the dataset
      <br /> - - means the model is not trained from scratch
       <br />
      <br /> 3️⃣Transfer learning
      <br /> - - means using a pre-trained model for a different but related task
      <br /> - - also means the model is not trained from scratch
      <br /> - - fine-tuning is a special case of transfer learning
      <br /> - - transfer learning can be done without fine-tuning (e.g. using the pre-trained model as a feature extractor and adding new layers to the model for training on the new task)

      <div> AI in Computer Vision part 01 👁️</div>


      <div> Computer Vision: a field of AI that teaches computers to "see" and interpret the visual world from images and videos, and derive meaningful information from them. </div>

          <div> First question: how does a model in our computer "see" an image? 👁️ 
           <br />
          - Model "sees" an image as numbers!
           <br />  
          - Digital images are made of pixels.
          <br />
          - Each pixel in the image is represented by a number (or a set of numbers for color images).  
        </div>  

  <div> 
    👁️ Images represented by numbers:
     <br />  
    - Two numbers for its width and height (how many pixels).
    <br />  
    e.g. 3840 x 2160 for 4K resolution        
    <br />      
    - Sometimes another number for how many color channels there are.
   <br />      
    e.g. 256 x 256 x 3 for an RGB color image
  </div>
  
  <div class='layout' style='grid-template-rows:55% 45%;'>
  <img src='images/mario.png'/>
  <div>Here is one way to numberify digital images:
     <br />  
  - Three numbers for each pixel representing the RGB values in color images, e.g. [256, 0, 128] for purple 🟪
     <br />     
  - One number for each pixel representing the greyscale value in grey images, e.g. [128] for a medium grey 🩶</div>
  <br />     
  - Put together these color-indicating numbers for all pixels in a multi-dimensional array (also called tensor in deep learning) to represent the image.
  </div>


  <div> After "seeing" the images, what meaningful information a model can derive from them? 👁️</div>

      <div> 
    👁️ Basic computer vision tasks: 
     <br />    
    - Image classification
      <br />
    - Object detection
      <br />
    - Image segmentation
      <br />
    - Keypoint detection
    
  </div>

        <div> 
    👁️ Basic computer vision tasks, characterised by the model (neural network) outputs:
     <br />    
    - Image classification: outputs a class label.
      <br />
    - Object detection: outputs bounding boxes and class labels.
      <br />
    - Image segmentation: outputs pixel-wise masks and class labels.
      <br />
    - Keypoint detection: outputs Keypoint and class labels.
       
  </div>


      <div> 
    👁️ What "meaningful information" can these tasks derive from images?
     <br />    
    - Image classification: what is in the image? 
      <br />
    - Object detection: what is in the image and where is it roughly?
      <br />
    - Image segmentation: what is in the image and where is it at the finest level?
      <br />
    - Keypoint detection: where are the important points/coordinates in the image?

  </div>



          <div> 
    👁️ Let's go to <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a> (have you explored this platform before?) for ready-to-use models (and web-based model inference APP) in:
     <br />    
    - Image classification
      <br />
    - Object detection
      <br />
    - Image segmentation
      <br />
    - Keypoint detection
  </div>

           <div> 
    👁️ Let's go to <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master">Tensorflow.js github repo</a> (have you explored this platform before?) for models and demos in:
     <br />    
    - Image classification
      <br />
    - Object detection

      <br /> - <a href="https://notnot.home.xs4all.nl/pareidolia/pareidolia.html">Pareidolia*</a>
      <br /> - - facial detection is applied to grains of sand. A fully automated robot search engine examines the grains of sand in situ. When the machine finds a face in one of the grains, the portrait is recorded.

       <br /> - - a large-scale kinetic sculpture in the form of an ancient Greek architectural pillar which observes its surroundings as if nodding to visitors, moving like a mutated snake.
